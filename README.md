This repository contains files from the 2022 project in the **Data Analysis course** of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The project concerns the analysis of 2020 and 2021 data regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. Namely, the project has 10 queries: 

1. Fit the distribution of the positivity rate in the European countries in weeks of 2020 and 2021 to known distributions

2. Comparison of the distribution of the positivity rate for the same weeks in 2020 and 2021 \
``` The null hypothesis that the two samples came from the same distribution is rejeced```
3. Comparison of the distribution of the positivity rate in Greece with the distribution of the positivity rate in Europe

5. Finding five european countries that have a similar positivity rate with Greece in the last quorter of 2021 \
`The country with the greatest correlation coefficient is Slovakia with 0.878901`
6. Finding one out of the five countries with the most significant correlation with Greece regarding the positivity rate \
`The two countries with the most significant correlation with Greece are Slovakia and Slovenia`
7. Can we predict the deaths in a country based on the positivity rate of the previous week?

8. Can we predict the deaths in Greece based on the positivity rate of the previous days? \
`For the 2020 period we cannot predict the deaths with great confidence, however for the 2021 period we can make predictions for the deaths using data from the 16 previous days`
9. How can we check if the model is suitable for predictions? 
10. Can we predict the deaths per day in Greece knowing other relative indexes of the previous days?
